# üê∞üí¨ pygmyapp/gateway
WebSocket server for real-time communication and events

## Dependencies
**Pygmy is built with Bun!** It doesn't run on node.js alone, [see here to install Bun](https://bun.com/docs/installation) or [here to learn more](https://bun.sh).

`pygmyapp/gateway` depends on:
- an active IPC server (`pygmyapp/ipc`), used for authentication
- an active REST API (`pygmyapp/rest`), used for reacting to REST events when they occur

## Install

### Manual

- Clone this repository
- Install dependencies with `bun install`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure environment variables

## Running

To start in production mode:

```sh
bun run prod
```

To run in dev mode (reload on file changes):

```sh
bun run dev
```

## Scripts

- `bun run lint`: runs Biome's linting, applies safe fixes, suggests fixes to errors, and auto-organizes imports
