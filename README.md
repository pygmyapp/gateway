# üê∞üí¨ pygmyapp/gateway
WebSocket server for real-time communication and events

## Dependencies
**Pygmy is built with Bun!** It doesn't run on node.js alone, [see here to install Bun](https://bun.com/docs/installation) or [here to learn more](https://bun.sh).

`pygmyapp/gateway` depends on:
- an active IPC server (`pygmyapp/ipc-server`), used for authentication
- an active REST API (`pygmyapp/rest`), used for reacting to REST events when they occur
